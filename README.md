# VA DATA PANDAS

The following is a project that answers the question "What is the risk of going back to schools
in Virginia in the Fall?" The latest update to the data was 8/17/20. Typing the command:
```python app.py``` in the terminal will create the page. From there go to this link ```http://127.0.0.1:8050/```
which will host the Plotly dash application on your local device. 

#Notes and Other Information

1.**Required Libaries** 
If you are running this on your local machine you will require to have installed the following
libaries: 
  ```
  re
  pandas
  dash
  plotly.express
  ```
2. **Miniconda terminal** 

If for some reason you are unable to ```pip3``` or ```pip``` install these then I would reccomend
using the **Anaconda Prompt(miniconda3)** terminal. This is the link: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/ . 

After you get said terminal then type in the following command : ```conda install -c plotly plotly``` and/or
```conda install -c conda-forge dash```. After it is done searching it will give a list of libraries and imports
that will also be installed. Type ```y``` and enter.
