# dataPanda

The following is a project that answers the question "What is the risk of going back to schools
in Virginia in the Fall?" The data is currently from July and being updated. Typing the command:
```python app.py``` in the terminal will create the page. From there go to this link ```http://127.0.0.1:8050/```
which will host the Plotly dash application on your local device. 

**Notes and other Information:**
1. The libraries that were used for these are as follows:
  ```
  re
  pandas
  dash
  plotly.express
  ```
2. If for some reason you are unable to ```pip3``` or ```pip``` install these then I would reccomend
using the **Anaconda Prompt(miniconda3)** terminal. This is the link: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/ . 

After you get said terminal then type in the following command : ```conda install -c plotly plotly``` and/or
```conda install -c conda-forge dash```. After it is done searching it will give a list of libraries and imports
that will also be installed. Type ```y``` and enter.
